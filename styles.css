animation:
    definition in words {
        A CSS animation is a sequence of visual changes applied to an element over a specified duration. 
        It allows for smooth transitions between different states of an element, such as changes in color, size, position, or opacity.
        CSS animations are defined using keyframes, which specify the styles at various points during the animation.
        The animation is controlled by properties such as duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, and direction.
