WEEK1
1. learnt how to asign spaces to flex items (eg flex:2)
2. learnt to use (over-flow: auto) to make flex container scrollabble.
3. understood the major difference between background-image properties:
    i. background-size: cover (used when the background-image is smaller than the conatinaer, it is used to stretch it.)
            &
    ii. background-size: contain (used when the background-size is larger than than the container, it resizes it the background-image size to fit the container)

4. unddrstood th e concept attribute selector in css
        Attribute Selectors
        The attribute selectors allow you to target an attribute found on an HTML element.

        1. Links with "facebook" anywhere in the URL
                a[href*="facebook"] {
                color: #3C5A99;
                }
        
        2. Internal links, beginning with "#"
                a[href^="#"] {
                background-color: gold;
                }
        
        3. Links that end in ".org"
                a[href$=".org"] {
                color: red;
                }

5. Position
        Positioning in CSS requires to use different CSS properties that allow you to position elements in your HTML webpage.

        /* not 100% browser support yet, but could be user in some cases */
        .component {
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
        }

animation:
    definition in words {
        A CSS animation is a sequence of visual changes applied to an element over a specified duration. 
        It allows for smooth transitions between different states of an element, such as changes in color, size, position, or opacity.
        CSS animations are defined using keyframes, which specify the styles at various points during the animation.
        The animation is controlled by properties such as duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, and direction.
    }

WEEK 2
1. understood the difference between the following css selectors
        i. parent  any-descendant{
                proper: value;
                }

        ii. parent > Direct-child {
                proper:value
                }
2. major difference between spread-operator and rest-operator
        i.      rest operator
                let A = [2,7,8,5,5,5]
                let [a,b,c,...d] = A
                used when tryin to when assigning a array of variable to an array then the rest operator ... inadition to the variable name to capture the rest of the arrays.

        ii.     spread operator
                let A = [2,7,8,5,5,5]
                let copy = [...A]
                this is used when you want to make a copy of an array data.
3.      What Is a Shallow Copy of an Array, and What Are Some Ways to Create  These Copies?
        i.      concate method 
                const copyArray = [].concat(originalArray);

        ii.     slice method 
                const copyArray = originalArray.slice();

        iii.    spread Operator 
                const copyArray = [...originalArray];

4.     How to Check If an Object Has a Property?
        i.      Objectname.hasOwnProperty("Propertyname")
        ii.     Propertyname in Objectname

5.      i.      the difference between premitive and non premitived data 
                types 
        ii.     creating objects 
        iii.    accessing objects and nested objects  (brackets notations dot (.) notations)

6.      he async and defer attributes in HTML script elements play a crucial 
        role in how JavaScript files are loaded and executed in web pages.
        i. By adding the async attribute to a script tag, the browser will continue parsing the HTML while the script is being downloaded. Once the script is fully downloaded, the browser will pause HTML parsing, execute the script, and then resume parsing the HTML.
        ii. The defer attribute is similar to async attribute. However, defer scripts are not executed immediately after they're downloaded. Instead, they wait until the HTML parsing is complete. Furthermore, defer scripts execute in the order they appear in the HTML code.
        
        NOTE:   use async for scripts where the order of execution doesn't matter, and use defer when you need to ensure that scripts run in the correct order.
7.      FETCH: The Fetch API allows web apps to make network requests,       
        typically to retrieve or send data to the server.
        By default, the Fetch API uses the GET method to retrieve data.

        difference Fetch API methods
        i.      GET: By default used to make network requests of retrieve     
                data from from a server.
        ii.     POST:  used for sending and creating new data or record to a 
                server
        iii.    PUT:    used for updating existing record/data on a server.
        iv.     DELETE: is used to delete a resource from the server.

8.      JavaScript promise creation, .then(parameter) .catch(parameter), JavaScript promise chainning
9.      async/await 
        example:        async function fetchUserData() {
                                try {
                                        let response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users`);
                                        let userData = await response.json();
                                        console.log(userData);
                                        } 
                                        
                                catch (error) {
                                        console.log("Error fetching user data:", error);
                                                }
                                        }
10.     JavaScript Engin: The JavaScript engine has the ability to read, understand, and execute your 
        code. It works like a converter that takes your code, turns it into instructions that the computer can understand and work accordingly.
        JavaScript Engin step:
                i.      parse
                ii.     compile
                iii.    execute
11.     The JavaScript runtime is the environment in which your 
        JavaScript code is executed. It includes 
        the JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox), which processes and executes the code, as well as additional features provided by the environment (such as a web browser or Node.js, which you will learn more about in future lessons).
        the runtime provides extra tools that allow JavaScript to interact with things outside of the language itself, like the DOM (for web pages) or the Fetch API (for making network requests)

12.     API call header:
         Headers
        Extra context: Headers are like luggage tags on your request or response. They carry extra information, including:
        Content-Type: Specifies the type of data (e.g., ‘text/html’, ‘application/json’).
        Authorization: Provides credentials to access protected resources.
        Cache-Control: Gives instructions on how to cache content (for performance).
        And many more!.
